The JSON file is bigger than the CSV file.
The JSON data is way more organized than the CSV data, even including the actual outcome of each pitch rather than numbers you have to translate, and while the CSV was also organized to a degree, it was nowhere close to that of the JSON file.
CSV stands for, "Comma-Seperated Values"; JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation".
When you open the CSV file, the data is sorted in columns and each row displays the results of one pitch. 
Some aspects of the data make sense in baseball terms, such as the ball/strike/out statistic, but some statistics,such as time, are irrelevant in baseball.
